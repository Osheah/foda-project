    "## Summarize the history of the Box Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis involves understanding datasets. This is difficult to do with raw unprocessed data. Descriptive statistics can help show the important aspects of the data. Common descriptive measures include measures of averageness such as mean, median and mode, the spread or variance of the data and the data quartiles i.e. the level at which a quartile of observations are below this value. Descriptive measures allow the dataset to be compared to other datasets. Summary statistics can be visualized to show the main characteristics of the dataset in an easily accessible way. One such visual summary method is the box plot (Potter, 2006).\n",

    "#### The 5 number summary\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot, also known as a 'box and whisker' plot clearly illustrates the *5 number summary*. This contains five descriptive statistics of the dataset, namely, its maximum and minimum value, its median and its upper and lower quartiles. The box plot is typically constructed along the vertical axis with a horizontal line segment drawn at the lower and upper quartile. These boundaries are used to construct a fence or box which indicates the interquartile range of the data. The median value is drawn across the box. Lines or whiskers are drawn at the top and base of the box. These are typically extended to the maximum and minimum (respectively) data values or to a multiple of the interquartile range (typically 1.5). Setting the whiskers to a proportion of the interquartile range allows for numbers outside of this range to be identified. These are called outliers. The width of the standard box plot is aesthetically selected.\n",

    "#### Definitions\n",
    "* The range - the span from the minimum data value to the maximum data value\n",
    "* The median - the value from which 50% of the data lies below it. It is calculated differently depending on whether the size of the dataset is odd or even. e.g. the even set 1,2,3,4,5,6 has median value midway between the values 3 and 4 i.e. 3.5. While the odd set  1,2,3,4,5,6,7 has median 4 as there are equal data values on either side of it. \n"

For example in the set 1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6 the lower quartile is found by dividing the data at the median (1, 2, 3)(4, 5, 6) and getting the median of the lower subset (1,2,3) e.g (1) 2 (3) - lower quartile is 2. The upper quartile is similarly calculated with the upper half of the data (4) 5 (6). The upper quartile is 5. "

This is was termed the H-spread of the data.

Any observations not within this range 2.5-97.5 are plotted as 'outlier' dots. An outlier is an data observation that is distant from other data in the dataset.

    "### History of the box plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The precursor of the box plot was the 1948 range bar chart (Haemer as cited in Potter, 2006). Haemer (ibid) suggested expanding information displayed on a range bar by annotating median/mean/mode, standard deviation and tolerance limits on the chart. Mary Spears in 1952 (as cited in Potter, 2006) developed this to show the *5 number summary*. She reduced the range bar to cover half the data (its interquartile range), used whiskers to extend this to the maximum and minimum data values and added a cross bar at the median value. Tukey, 1977 developed the ubiquitous box plot in its modern form, by reducing the length of the whiskers to cover 1.5 times the interquartile range length. This allowed outliers to emerge, which are individually marked in the box plot. Tukey did not shade in his box unlike the range bar chart. In addition Tukey added cross bars to the ends of the whiskers. The box plot continued its minimalistic journey with the percentile plot which removed the box altogether and indicated the median by a small gap. Other variations of this is the abbreviated box plot which removes the sides of the box and indicates the median by small horizontal symmetric T bars (Potter, 2006). Minimalistic designs were typically used to display along side other graphing methods such as distributions or scatter plots. \n",

    "### Box plot modifications and alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "The box plot allows the 5 number summary to be quickly conveyed however there is key information that the standard box plot lacks. Information on distribution symmetry, data variation and mean are absent. These features can often be added to the box plot when required.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Density information\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard box plot does not show the most common data values. The same 5 number statistics can have very different distribution shapes. This is problematic when trying to identify the distribution of the data as comparing it to other data distributions may be inappropriate. Benjamini (as cited in Potter) developed the hist plot as a simple method for adding density information. Here the median, upper and lower quartile density distribution is indicated by the width of their respective line segments. These are then connected by straight lines giving a hexagonal shape to the box. Benjamini developed this further with the vaseplot which includes estimates for each datum's density within the interquartile range. Confidence intervals can also be indicated by the width of a shaded bar around the median (Potter, 2006). Esty and Banfield, (as cited in Potter 2006) modified the box plot to include each points percentile distribution with their box percentile plot. Here the width of the box at each point is proportional the percentile value of the data till the median is reached then the width becomes proportional less its corresponding percentile. Again lines are drawn at the median and upper and lower quartiles. This plot covers the whole of the data, reducing ambiguity unlike whisker plots which can vary on how whiskers are calculated. Hintze and Nelson merged box plots and density displays with their violin plots (Hintze and Nelson, as cited in Potter, 2006). The violin plot replaces the median with a circle and the box with a thick black line. Like the percentile plot, the violin plot covers all the data and includes a density trace. The density trace is shown two symmetrical curves either side of the plot. The width interval can be specified and is typically set at 0.15 times the range of the data. Cohen and Cohen as cited in Potter, 2006 developed the sectioned density plot that uses perception depth to simulate a three dimensional representation of the data variation and central tendency. Sections overlap to give depth visual cues. This type of plot is created by dividing the data into fixed width sections which are plotted against a black background. The intervals are plotted in order from lowest density to highest density with each interval occluding the interval preceding it. Each additional interval is shifted slightly left of the interval before it and shaded slightly lighter than its predecessor. The 5 number summary is shown on the axis by a thin white box covering the interquartile range and white horizontal whiskers extending from the median, lower and upper quartiles to cover the density sections. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Adding descriptive statistics information\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes adding density information is not required (or possible to achieve) but the box plot as it is, is still missing some essential information. For example comparing datasets with density information side by side could quickly crowd the plot obscuring information and possibly leading to wrong conclusions. McGill et al (as cited in Potter, 2006) suggested the variable width box plot, altering the box width to indicate the dataset size. This helps avoid misinterpretations by signaling the number of observations in each dataset. The notched box plot indicates the significant differences in values or confidence interval. If there is no overlap with the notches then there is strong evidence for the datasets having different means or distributions [ref](https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home/notched-box-plots). The variable width box plot and notched plot can be combined to show information about confidence intervals and size of distribution. The addition of density to box plots allowed for identifying different underlying distributions with similar 5 number summaries but density box plots are not always possible with large datasets. In these cases descriptive statistics can be used instead of density to indicate key aspects of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Common statistical measures included skewness and kurtosis. Skewness is a measure of how symmetrical the dataset is and kurtosis is a measure of how pointy the distribution of the data is. These measures can be added to the box plot by adding thick lines at the quartiles or median when the data is skewed in that direction. For example a thick line at the upper quartile would indicate right skewness and at the lower quartile it would indicate left skewness. If both ends are thickened then a bimodal distribution is indicated. A thick line at the median would indicate a central peak (kurtosis). \n",
    "\n",
    "![Skewness and Kurtosis and Beam Fulcrum](![image.png](img/descstatboxplot.JPG))\n",
    "\n",
    "Doane and Tracy, as cited in Potter, 2006 developed the beam and fulcrum plot to use in conjunction with the box plot. Here the range is displayed as a line with the fulcrum pivot placed at the mean. Tick marks on the beam are placed at the standard deviation points and dots are added to show modality. The fulcrum base width can indicate the confidence interval. This type of plot makes it easy to identify non normal distributions and outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extensions to two variables \n",
    "\n",
    "The box plot is a simple way to show the 5 number summary on one dimension. It can be used on bivariate but the challenge is how to represent this in visual form while still keeping the minimalistic design of the box plot. There are several bivariate box plots that show the 5 number summary as well as data location, spread, skewness and correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such plot is the rangefinder box plot as developed by Becketti and Gould (as cited in Potter, 2006). This extends the box plot to two dimensions. This contains a scatterplot of the data. In addition it shows, for each of the two variables,  the 5 number summary with the range of the box plot for one dataset being displayed perpendicular to the range of the box plot for the other dataset. The rangefinder plot was improved by the addition of cross hair bars showing the upper and lower quartiles. This plot displays two sets of data with their 5  number summary on the same chart but does not include any information on the correlation between the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two dimensional representations of the box plot focus on the hinge at the median and the fence of the box. Different two dimensional methods differ in how the hinge and fence are represented and contours calculated. The two dimensional box plot (Tongkumchum, as cited in Potter, 2006) finds a robust line within the data. The data is divided into three sections. The median of the two outer sections is found and used to plot the robust line. The fences are drawn parallel to the robust line or the axis. Only the outer fence and inner hinge fences are drawn. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rousseeuw as cited in Potter 2006 developed the bagplot which sections the data into a bag, fence and loop. The deepest location or depth median is encapsulated by the 'bag' which holds half the data values with the largest depth. The fence is 3 times this area and is not drawn. Values between the bag and the fence are shaded and those outside the fence are outliers. The bagplot is a method of showing the location, spread, correlation skewness and tails of the datset.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bagplot](img\\Bagplot-of-a-bivariate-data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[ref](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/41578/what-is-a-bagplot-or-bivariate-boxplot). Outliers are represented as stars (the bagplot is also known as the star plot). The data within the bag is often not plotted but surrounded by a line. Confidence areas can be added by a splatter at the depth median (Potter, 2006). Goldberg and Iglewicz delveloped the relplot and quelplot. These use concentric ellipses to mark the hinge and fence sections. The relplot assumes symmetric data and uses estimators such as minimum volume of the ellipse shape.Whereas the quelplot quarters the ellipse along its axes and uses an M-estimator for construction. This plot can show skewness as the quarters of the ellipse can be misshapen (Potter, 2009).  \n",

    "#### Alternatives\n",
    "The box plot is a simple way of showing the descriptive statistics of the 5 number summary. It has adaptations to include density, skewness and kurtosis as well as central tendencies and confidence intervals. In addition it can be extended to bivariate data. Alternatives to box plots and its modifications are non box plot ways to display data in order to see its characteristics. \n",
    "##### Histogram\n",
    "For numerical data a key method of data visualization is the histogram. The histogram counts the number of values within a specified interval and then plots them by drawing a bar chart. The histogram shows certain characteristics of the dataset. It can show modality, i.e if the distribution looks uniform, unimodal such as a normal distribution or bimodel. Histograms can also indicate skewness. Skewness is a measure of asymmetry. A histogram can show the direction of skewness (right skewed is pulled to the right or positively skewed and left skewed is pulled to the left or negatively skewed). Histograms can show information about the quantiles with the thickness of their tails. Outliers can also be identified if one datum has its bar some distance away from the rest of the bars on the histogram. The box plot lacks this ability to find modality within the data.  \n",
    "##### Quantile - Quantile Plots (QQ Plots)\n",
    "QQ plots compare dataset values against a known distribution. Typically the dataset is compared against a normal qq plot. This can identify if the dataset is normally distributed. Normal distribution is often a prerequisite for many statistical inferential tests. If the qq plot of the data is close to the Normal QQ Plot line then it is likely that the data is normally distributed. Normal QQ plots are constructed by calculating z scores where the z score of the datum is the datum value minus the sample mean all divided by the sample standard deviation. Transformations can be used to transform non normal data to allow it to be compared to the Normal QQ plot. If the data is positively skewed then log or square root transformations can be applied; If the data is negatively skewed use exponential or square transformations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparisons of visual summary techniques\n",
    "* Histograms can summarise any numerical data. The show the shape, modality, skewness, quantiles and presence of outliers however the length of the bar (its bin size) can influence how the histogram is interpreted. In addition they are very bulky and not easy to compare to other datasets on the one chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Box plots do not have to worry about bin size interpretations. They easily convey information about 5 number summaries, skewness, quartiles and outliers. Multiple datasets can be easily compared side by side. However modality cannot be estimated and there is some evidence of cognitive bias with interpretation of whiskers [ref](add some reference here) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* QQ Plots can show if the data comes from a known distribution. Like box plots there is no difficulty with interpretation of 'bin' sizes. They can summarise quartile information. However multiple datasets are hard to compare side by side. In addition skewness, modality and presence of outliers are hard to identify. \n",
