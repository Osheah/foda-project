    "### John W. Tukey\n",
    "\n",
    "John W. Tukey was a prominent mathematician. He received his phd in mathematics from Princeton University where he went on to be a professor in conjunction to working at AT&T Bell Laboratories.  He made many contributions to statistics and data analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tukey invented the prototype box plot or 'schematic plot - box and whiskers' in his  1970 preliminary edition of Exploratory Data Analysis (1977). The preliminary edition summarised and were influenced by three previous limited volumes used as his teaching material. He prefaced this volume with the quote\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is important to understand what you CAN Do before you learn to measure how WELL you seem to have DONE it\n",
    "Tukey, 1977. \n",
    "\n",
    "His book focused on data analysis investigation techniques and simple calculations and drawings that aid analysis. Tukey focused on simplifying data descriptions and expanding analysis past the surface level. Like Anscombe (1936?) he was a great believer in a simple picture that express the main characteristic of the data in a clear and unambigious way. Tukey promoted a exploration and confirmation approach to data analysis and to try out methods, even if they are unsuccessful.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tukey's Box and whisker plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Tukey's book contained problems that could all be done by hand. His first 6 chapters formed the core methods. Box and whisker plots were introduced in chapter 2 Schematic Summaries. Tukey's plot was very similar to the earlier range-bar developed by Mary Spear (1952). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some terms\n",
    "\n",
    "###### range\n",
    "The range is the interval from its lowest to highest value it can refer to both the x axis values (the domain) or the y axis values (the codomain) if there is a function between the two. For example the range in the following set $ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10$  $is$ $[0-10]$ as 0 is the lowest value and 10 is the highest value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### percentiles \n",
    "The k percentile is a statistical measure in which there is a given percent (k) of data observations below this mark. For example the highest score on a test is 100% so a 40% percentile is score below which 40% percent of the data lies. There are some common names for certain percentiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The lower quartile is the 25% percentile. There are 25% of data observations below this mark.\n",
    "* The median is the 50% percentile. There are 50% of data observations below this mark. \n",
    "* The upper quartile is the 75% percentile. There are 75% of data observations below this mark. \n",
    "* The interquartile range is the differences between the 75% and 25% percentiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spear's range bar precursor illustrated the data's range (lowest value and highest value), and key data 'k' percentiles of the median, lower quartile, upper quartile and the interquartile range as well as the data's range. The range bar is presented horizontally. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Spear's Range Bar](img\\spearrangebar.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tukey took this idea of '5 number summaries' and presented it vertically with 'hinges' or lines drawn at the 25%, 50% and 75% mark. The 25% mark was used to construct the bottom of the box and the 75% mark was used to construct the top of the box, with the median indicated by straight line mark within this box. This is was termed the H-spread of the data. The horizontal width of the box does not convey any statistical significance in Tukey's model and can be drawn for aesthetics, although the box should not be squarish. There are two 'whiskers' extending from the midpoint of the top and bottom of the box. These indicate the data distribution outside of the interquartile range. The top whisker goes from the 75% mark to the 97.5% quartile and the bottom whisker extends from the 2.5% quartile to the 25% quartile. Any observations not within this range 2.5-97.5 are plotted as 'outlier' dots. An outlier is an data observation that is distant from other data in the dataset. It could indicate an error in data collection or be significant and it frequently affects statistical analysis skewing the data. Often outliers are removed from the dataset for this reason.\n",
